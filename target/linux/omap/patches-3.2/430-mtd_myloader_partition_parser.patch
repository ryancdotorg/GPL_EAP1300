+	---help---
+	  MyLoader is a bootloader which allows the user to define partitions
+	  in flash devices, by putting a table in the second erase block
+	  on the device, similar to a partition table. This table gives the 
+	  offsets and lengths of the user defined partitions.
+
+	  If you need code which can detect and parse these tables, and
+	  register MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image detected,
+	  enable this option.
+
+	  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
+	  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically.
